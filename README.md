## Overview

This repository acts as the structural boilerplate for my keystone projects.

## Getting Started

Note that yarn and a container engine are required for this project.

**If you are using Windows as your main environment, WSL is *strongly* recommended as using the devcontainer is very inconsistent on just Windows.**
**This means to use the `code .` command in WSL. You can read more [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).**

For a container engine, one of the following is recommended:
- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) (Recommended)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Validated)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/) (Untested)

Here are the steps to use to the boilerplate (assuming WSL and Docker):
1. Install WSL
2. Install Docker
3. Enable WSL Integration for Ubuntu in Docker
4. Install VS Code and Remote Development extension
5. Install Terminal (recommended)
6. In Ubuntu (use Terminal), create directory
7. Clone the repository, git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
8. Open the repository in VSCode, code .
9. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.devcontainer/.env`
10. Run `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` in the command pallet in VSCode (`CTRL+SHIFT+P` by default)
11. Using the terminal inside of VSCode, run `yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the CMS.

## Technology Stack

The following are the notable libraries used in the boilerplate:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [KeystoneJS](https://keystonejs.com/)
  - [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is used by KeystoneJS and is the database engine
